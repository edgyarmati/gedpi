# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to Codex and other AI agents when working with code in this repository.

`AGENTS.md` is the canonical agent guidance for this repository. Keep harness-specific files such as `CLAUDE.md` as thin pointers to this file instead of duplicating the full instructions; if guidance changes, update this file first.

## Commands

- `npm test` — run the test suite (Vitest)
- `npm run check` — TypeScript type-check
- `npm run lint` — Biome lint + format check (use `npm run format` to auto-fix)
- `node ./bin/gedpi.js` — launch locally in dev mode

## Architecture

GedPi is a batteries-included Pi package built around a single conversational brain.

**Agent flow**: GedPi always starts in full workflow mode. One brain clarifies ambiguous requests, writes the spec into `.ged/`, breaks work into bounded slices, implements them, and records verification/results in durable memory. The agent classifies tasks as trivial or non-trivial and adjusts its behavior accordingly — no manual toggle needed.

Future orchestration work should follow `docs/single-writer-intelligence-orchestration.md`: keep the primary Ged brain as the user-facing decision owner, use `pi-subagents` for explorer/planner/plan-reviewer/verifier roles, use `pi-intercom` only for blocked decisions or progress-changing discoveries, and keep `ged-worker` optional/settings-gated behind a main-agent worker-suitability check. Do not expose generic bundled subagent agents by default, and do not reintroduce unstructured writer swarms.

**Memory**: `.ged/` files hold durable project standards, context, and Ged workflow state — not source code. `.pi/` is Pi-runtime-local state and should stay out of Git.

**Extensions**: Pi loads extensions listed in `package.json` under `pi.extensions`. Custom entrypoints live in `extensions/`. Third-party extensions are referenced via `./node_modules/` paths.

**Bundled extensions and extension packages**:
- `ged-core` — brain workflow, header, shortcuts, updater, and `.ged/` durable memory bootstrap
- `glimpseui` — native micro-UI windows and floating companion widget
- `pi-web-access` — web search and fetch tools
- `pi-subagents` — subagent tool, chains/parallelism, Ged-specific roles, and optional settings-gated worker support
- `pi-intercom` — direct supervisor coordination for blocked subagent decisions
- `pi-diff-review` — diff review surface
- `pi-prompt-template-model` — prompt template / model wiring
- `@plannotator/pi-extension` — visual plan/code review UI used by the `plannotator` draft-plan review preference
- `agent-settings.ts` — preferences persistence in `~/.gedoc/settings.json`
- GedPi uses Pi's native input, footer, working indicator, command palette, user-message, tool, and read rendering; keep custom UI overrides out unless intentionally reintroduced.

**Skills**: Bundled workflow skills live in `skills/`. Pi discovers them via `pi.skills` in `package.json`.
Bundled defaults now include `find-skills`, `skill-creator`, and `brainstorming`, so Ged can discover, create, and use planning-oriented skills without external installation.

## Workflow

Always document plans and progress. Before making changes, state what you intend to do. After completing tasks, summarize what was done.

### Updating workflow prompts and agent contracts

When changing Ged's workflow, update the durable documentation and generated prompt sources together so new sessions inherit the same rules:

- `src/brain.ts` controls the text appended to the main agent system prompt.
- `src/orchestration.ts` controls the detailed subagent orchestration contract and guard messages.
- `src/agent-settings.ts` controls the bundled Ged runtime agent prompts generated into `.pi/agents/`: `ged-explorer`, `ged-planner`, `ged-plan-reviewer`, `ged-verifier`, and optional `ged-worker`.
- `src/commit-settings.ts` controls user-configurable workflow preferences that are also appended to the system prompt.
- `AGENTS.md` documents the intended workflow for future coding sessions.
- Keep GedOC parity in mind when prompt/checkpoint behavior is duplicated there.

For non-trivial work, the main agent must run the first clarification/sufficiency pass before planning. Use grill-me in chat when goal, users/audience, scope, constraints, relevant context, risks, tests, or success criteria are unclear. If the request is already clear, synthesize that evidence instead of asking unnecessary questions. With subagents enabled, dispatch `ged-explorer` after clarification to perform read-only skill-fit reconnaissance (inventory/evaluate/search) plus codebase discovery; the main agent then adjudicates findings and performs any mutating project-skill install/create actions. The `ged-planner` role now authors the draft SPEC/TASKS/TESTS plan from clarified requirements and explorer findings; the main agent accepts/edits/rejects that draft, writes final `.ged` plan files, and records `planAcceptance` before source edits. Human/Glimpse plan review applies to the accepted/written draft, followed by optional `ged-plan-reviewer` critique according to critique mode. `ged-worker` is disabled by default and should only be enabled for bounded, disjoint, approved implementation slices after a worker-suitability check; if a slice is too difficult, ambiguous, risky, coupled, hard to verify, or judgment-heavy, the main agent implements it directly. Worker completions are `workerRuns` audit metadata and never replace verifier review or main-agent acceptance. After `ged-verifier` reports issues, the main agent fixes accepted findings directly by default and reruns verification rather than re-invoking a worker, except for rare new isolated mechanical slices.

The Ged workflow is always active:
- lazily initialize or migrate `.ged/` on the first real agent turn
- discover external standards files such as `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`, `.cursor/rules/**/*.mdc`, `.cursorrules`, `.windsurf/rules/**`, and `.continue/rules/**`
- ask the user whether to keep repo-wide standards in Ged's durable config
- use `ged-explorer` for read-only skill-fit reconnaissance when subagents are enabled, then automatically install matching task skills into `.ged/project-skills/`, create a project skill when none exists, track skill dependencies per task, and remove project-scoped skills once no open task still depends on them
- ensure `.pi/` is ignored in `.gitignore` when the project is a Git repo

**Commits**: After completing any task — including individual implementation slices, bug fixes, refactors, or cleanup — create a git commit to snapshot the work. Commit every change you make unless the user explicitly asks not to. Before committing, run the relevant verification for the touched area and fix any failures. Use conventional commit format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`, etc.). Never leave completed work uncommitted. Check `git status` after each task; if there are staged or unstaged changes, commit them.

**Changelog**: Every committed change that is user-facing (features, fixes, behavior changes, dependency bumps, deprecations) must add an entry under `## Unreleased` in `CHANGELOG.md`. Group entries by category (`### Features`, `### Fixes`, `### Documentation`, `### Dependencies`, etc.). Keep the changelog current during each slice — don't batch it at release time. On release, `## Unreleased` is renamed to `## X.Y.Z - YYYY-MM-DD` and a fresh `## Unreleased` header is added.

## Releases

GedPi is published to npm as `gedpi`.

### How to release

1. Ensure `CHANGELOG.md` has all changes under `## Unreleased`.
2. Bump `version` in `packages/gedpi/package.json` to the new version.
3. Rename `## Unreleased` to `## X.Y.Z - YYYY-MM-DD` and add a new `## Unreleased` section at the top.
4. Commit: `chore: release gedpi X.Y.Z`.
5. Tag: `git tag gedpi-vX.Y.Z`.
6. Push: `git push origin main --tags`.
7. The `release-gedpi.yml` workflow will: verify → npm pack → npm publish with provenance → create GitHub release.

### Tag format

- GedPi releases use `gedpi-v*` tags (e.g., `gedpi-v0.13.0`).
- GedOC releases use `gedoc-v*` tags — they are independent.

### Packaging guardrails

- Do not add published `file:` dependencies that point at vendored directories already included in `files` or loaded through `pi.extensions`. Npm may install nested `node_modules` inside those vendored directories, which can break global upgrades with stale `ENOTEMPTY` removal errors.
- For vendored extension code, include the source directory through `files`, load it via the `pi.extensions` path, and use peer dependencies for host-provided packages such as `glimpseui` and Pi APIs.
- Before releasing packaging changes, run `npm pack --dry-run` and confirm the tarball does not include nested `node_modules`, package lockfiles from vendored directories, or dependency links to vendored packages.

### Deprecation note

The previous npm package `omni-pi` is deprecated. `gedpi` is the active package.

## TypeScript

- ES modules only — NodeNext module resolution, `import.meta.url` for paths. No CommonJS in `src/` or `extensions/`.
- Strict mode enabled. `npm run check` must pass before committing.
- `bin/gedpi.js` is plain JS (not TypeScript) — the launcher has no compile step.

## Testing

Tests live in `tests/`. Vitest covers the durable planning/implementation workflow and extension wiring.

## Model API Keys

The Pi runtime manages model credentials externally. No API key setup is required in this repo.
